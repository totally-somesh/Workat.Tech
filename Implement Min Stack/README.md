Implement a stack that supports the following operations in O(1) time complexity:

push(x) : Push the element x onto the stack.
pop() : Removes the element at the top of the stack.
top() : Get the topmost element of the stack.
getMin() : Get the minimum element in the stack.
Assume that pop, top and getMin will only be called on non-empty stack.
