The cumulative sum of an array at index i is defined as the sum of all elements of the array from index 0 to index i.

Examples :-

Initial Array: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 3, 6, 10]

Initial Array: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Initial Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Given an array, return its cumulative sum.
