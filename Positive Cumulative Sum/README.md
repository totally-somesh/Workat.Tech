The cumulative sum of an array at index i is defined as the sum of all elements of the array from index 0 to index i.

Examples :-

Initial Array: [1, -2, 3, 4, -6]
Cumulative Sum: [1, -1, 2, 6, 0]

The positive cumulative sum of an array is a list of only those cumulative sums which are positive.

Examples :-

Initial Array: [1, -2, 3, 4, -6]
Cumulative Sum: [1, -1, 2, 6, 0]
Positive Cumulative Sum: [1, 2, 6]


Initial Array: [1, -1, -1, -1, 1]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 0, -1, -2, -1]
Positive Cumulative Sum: [1]


Initial Array: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 4, 9, 16]
Positive Cumulative Sum: [1, 4, 9, 16]

Given an array, return its positive cumulative sum.
